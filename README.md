An ArduBoy game made entirely by trial and error with ChatGPT 4.


Heads-Up Charade

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing. I have never put any real effort into programming. I know some basic stuff, I can read the code - kinda. I can copy and paste. 

Take any, all, or none of this code.

I used a random online converter to convert from yaml to json, for no reason.
https://jsonformatter.org/yaml-to-json
https://github.com/nick-aschenbach/game-words/blob/master/assets/game_words/game_words.yaml

Then I asked GPT to make a utility to convert json word lists to .h header file word lists to be used in the game. It's in the index.html
